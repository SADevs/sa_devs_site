Summary: About the SA Developers Group

## Who we are

We are a group of developers who live in and around San Antonio, TX. We are a techology agnostic group and spend our time collaborating on projects, asking and answering questions regarding technology or career development, and meeting together to share ideas, projects, and more. 

We are an inclusive group of people, and if you want to get to know more developers in the San Antonio area, this is the group to be a part of. Additionally, if you are looking for more opportunities, please reach out in the Slack group. If there are job opportunities available, we will make those known. 

Please check out our [rules](/pages/rules.html), as well.
