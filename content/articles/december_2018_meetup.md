## Event Details

**Location**: Pho Cong Ly<br>
**Sponsor**: Noodles<br>

Several members are meeting to share some Pho.

I'm excited about this one, as I love Pho and I like trying new places.

Many of the members planning to attend are remote developers. If you work remotely, be sure to get out of the house and meet some of your fellow hermits.
