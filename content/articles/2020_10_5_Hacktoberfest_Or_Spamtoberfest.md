Summary: An opinion on contributing to open source projects during Hacktoberfest

# To Hacktober or Not to Hacktober?

So in light of some recent events, mostly from a Youtuber with a large following,
there was a "wave" of "spammy" PRs (Pull Requests) where "contributors" would
add some text without much context and would be considered valid PRs.

I sympathize with the Youtuber, and I believe they had good intentions, but I believe
this lines up with the overall mentality of Imposter Syndrome which many of us, including
myself, share. The concept of contributing to an open source project is noble and exciting.
Some projects are only alive because of a community that enjoys the service or project
that has postively impacted their profession. ([Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust)). However, I think there is an underlying barrier
that can scare off would be contributors.

These contributors instead only "contribute" by correcting `README`s. Generally,
PRs should address issues raised by others contributing to the project. Corrections
to a projects' `README` is warranted but should impactful to the reader rather than
a üëç reaction / comment for the sake of only making a PR. Maybe the results of the "spam"
PRs is due to some unintentional intimidation that even some more seasoned developers have experienced.

In light of these outcomes and sentiments I believe that the open source community
shouldn't suffer because of this but rather "inform" would be contributors and follow
a sort of "honor" system. It should be considered a "given" or even an expectation that
open source projects would be subject to being "spammed". Perhaps if these projects were more
prepared and prefaced with a more "beginner" friendly set of instructions, they could
reduce the "contributor" learning curve. Maybe, create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` to a project
to help other open source contributors. üòâ

## Recommendations to contributors

If you are looking to contribute to an open source project, be mindful of your contribution.
You may only interact with this project once in your life, more specifically only during Hacktoberfest.
Imagine you are a "tourist" in France and you would like to add your "Lock of Love" to a
particular chain-link fence. Your contribution may not seem like much, but as a city employee
that might have to "maintain" said fence, it can be overwhelming. 

The city employee(s) that maintains the fence of locks is aware of these contributions 
and should provide guidelines to would be "romeos" about the Do's and Don't of adding a lock to the fence.
Order and community rules allow for a more enjoyable experience for all who chose to contribute.

As a contributor, don't be afraid of rules or for that matter, contributing. It is an experience that
many don't get the chance to take part of. It is an act that allows us to become an active member
of our tech community and even grow as a developer. 

Maybe your _first_ PR is editing a README, that's okay. Challenge yourself to make more "meaningful"
contributions to the open source community and projects.
