# First Annual SA Developers Advent of Code (AoC) Code Jam

Welcome all members of the San Antonio Web Developers community and Slack group. I do
apologize for the late entry for this article but better late then never. At the time of
this writing there are 13 hrs (CST) until the first challenge is released.  

This is an open invitation and challenge to all developers who want to flex their skills
or try out a new language while solving programming puzzles.

## What is Advent of Code (AoC)
If you are unfamiliar with AoC, I would recommned that you go to their about page [HERE](https://adventofcode.com/2018/about)

TL;DR;

 **Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.**

A new puzzle is release / unlocked at midnight EST/UTC-5 every day from Dec 1 to Dec 25

## How Do I Join

First you will need to sign in to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), You can link

You can also post comments / questions / ~~boast of programming superiority~~ help other
members of the SADev community. This should be a **FUN** way to interact with each other.

## Is this worth my time

Objectively, YES. You get to meet / compete with other developers in the SA Developer community
and bask in the glory that is being higher ranked than some other seasoned developers. Bwahahaha!!

There's also a gift card / cash prize for the winner or potential winners at the end of the challenge.
As of this writing, the current prize is valued at ðŸ’°$30ðŸ’°. The prize purse can potentially grow depending
on the generousity of other developers in the community who wish to contribute.

Thanks and have fun!
