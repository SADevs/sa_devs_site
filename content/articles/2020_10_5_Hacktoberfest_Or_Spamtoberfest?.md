Summary: An opinion on contributing to open source projects during Hacktoberfest

# To Hacktober or Not to Hacktober?

So in light of some recent events, mostly from a Youtuber with a large following,
there was a "wave" of "spammy" PRs (Pull Requests) where "contributors" would
add some text without out much context and that would be considered a valid PR.

I sympathize with the Youtuber and I believe they had good intentions but I believe
this lines up with the overall mentality of Imposter Syndrome which many of us, including
myself, share. I think the concept of contributing to an open sourced project is
noble and some projects are only alive because of a community that enjoys the service
or project but I think there is some underlying barrier that can scare off would be
contributors.

These contributors instead only "contribute" by correcting `README`s. Though in
some cases this is necessary, from what I have read and experienced, this is not the case.
Maybe the results of the "spam" PRs is due to some unintentional intimidation that
even some more seasoned developers have experienced.

In light of these outcomes and sentiments I believe that the open source community
shouldn't suffer because of this but rather "inform" would be contributors and follow
a sort of "honor" system. It should be considered a "given" or even an expectation that
open source projects would be subject to being "spammed". Perhaps if these projects were more
prepared and prefaced with a more "beginner" friendly set of instructions they could
reduce the "contributor" learning curve.

## Recommendations to contributors

If you are looking to contribute to an open source project be mindful of your contribution.
You may only interact with this project once in your life, more specifically only during Hacktoberfest.
Imagine you are a "tourist" in France and you would like to add your "Lock of Love" to a
particular chain-link fence. Your contribution may not seem like much but as a city employee
that might have to "maintain" said fence, it can be overwhelming. 

The city employee(s) that maintains the fence of locks is aware of these contributions 
and should provide guidelines to would be "romeos" about the Do's and Don't of adding a lock to the fence.
Order and community rules allow for a more enjoyable experience for all who chose to contribute.

As a contributor, don't be afraid of rules or for that matter contributing. It is an experience that
many don't get the chance to take part of. It is an act that allows us to become an active member
of our tech community and even grow as a developer. 

Maybe your _first_ PR is editing a README, that's okay. Challenge yourself to make more "meaningful"
contributions to the open source community and projects.
