We had a good group of people go up to iHeartMedia, eat pizza, hang out, and listen to some great presentations.

Here are the slides from the WebSockets discussion and the Github repo with the code: [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15ihtz4B9f0ArCAsqdCZn2wBWPlS3ogmvoMlL442n0us) - [repo](https://github.com/th3n3wguy/sadevs-websocket-demo). The slides from Big Jon's talk are coming soon.
