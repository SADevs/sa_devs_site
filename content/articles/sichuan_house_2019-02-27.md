Happy year of the pig, SA Devs! ![Pig](/images/zodiac-pig.png)

We will be having our first scheduled dinner together at one of the best Chinese restaurants in San Antonio: Sichuan House. 

Sichuan food is known to be spicy (peppercorns) and flavorful, so make sure to gather your dependencies and prepare for some spicy food.

The eating style will be communal, so you won't have your own order -- we're all sharing the bill! We will order some plates of meat and vegetables and share from those plates. We will also get some white rice and cold dishes to whet our appetites and fill our bellies.

Let's celebrate the Year of the Pig as the lazy developers we are!

Note about the year of the pig:

Pig is not thought to be a smart animal in China. It likes sleeping and eating and becomes fat. Thus it usually features laziness and clumsiness. On the positive side, it behaves itself, has no plan to harm others, and can bring affluence to people. Consequently, it has been regarded as wealth.
