# SA Devs Season of Giving Finale

Season of Giving is completed for 2020! Our community raised $1126.00 through our charitable donations and work in the month of November! The SA Devs organization has matched this with a $1126.00 donation to the SA Food Bank, providing meals for almost 8000 people!

I am personally overwhelmed with gratitude and pride for everyone who participated. Thank you all for helping to end food insecurity here in South Texas!
