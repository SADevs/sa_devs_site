&lt;p&gt;Several members are meeting to share some Pho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm excited about this one, as I love Pho and I like trying new places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the members planning to attend are remote developers. If you work remotely, be sure to get out of the house and meet some of your fellow hermits.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="meetup"></category><category term="events"></category></entry><entry><title>Podcasts on Development</title><link href="https://sanantoniodevs.com/podcasts-on-development.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-12-01T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2018-12-01T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Omar Quimbaya</name></author><id>tag:sanantoniodevs.com,2018-12-01:/podcasts-on-development.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A short survey of interesting podcasts to listen to about development.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Podcasts on Development&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love listening to podcasts. It is like listening to your own personal radio station where they talk about things you care about and want to learn about. Podcasts have been exploding in recent years because they are accessible, interesting, and allow anyone the opportunity to share a story, illustrate their expertise, or report on a niche topic that is under-represented by the general news media. Software development, Devops, programming, and tech in general have a lot of niche topics within, and there are plenty of podcasts out there covering many aspects of the field in which we all work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, because podcasts are so prevalent and easy to produce, the quality of them vary, so it is hard to know what is good and what is not good without spending a lot of time listening to these shows and getting a feel for them. A quick look at &lt;a href="https://simpleprogrammer.com/ultimate-list-developer-podcasts/"&gt;https://simpleprogrammer.com/ultimate-list-developer-podcasts/&lt;/a&gt; shows us the sheer amount of podcasts that are out there for different topics within development, so it can be a dizzying experience trying to pick one that is potentially of a high enough quality to deserve our subscription and time to listen to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I will make a few recommendations based on the podcasts that I listen to and provide some guidance on how best to approach finding your next favorite software development podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://bikeshed.fm/"&gt;The Bike Shed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bike Shed is a podcast from the good people at &lt;a href="https://thoughtbot.com/"&gt;ThoughtBot&lt;/a&gt;. ThoughtBot is a software development firm that creates apps for both small and large customers. A San Antonio equivalent would be &lt;a href="https://grok.rocks"&gt;Grok Interactive&lt;/a&gt;, which actually used to have a podcast but stopped due to timing constraints. The Bike Shed focuses on the experiences and thoughts of the developers at ThoughtBot as they talk about some of the things they are working on, both professionally and contributing to open source, and what they think about what they are doing. A notable episode that I would recommend people to listen to first before diving into the Bike Shed would be episode 172: &lt;a href="http://bikeshed.fm/172"&gt;What I Believe About Software&lt;/a&gt;. In that episode, they talk about the core processes they use to develop software, focusing on planning, deadlines, code reviews, and retrospectives. Quite often, we think about software as something that is written once and it is all done, but much like any quality writing, software needs to be rewritten, reconfigured, retooled, etc at a regular enough cadence to keep it efficient, clean, and maintainable. For an understanding of why the show is called "The Bike Shed," see this article &lt;a href="http://bikeshed.com/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Fun note: every time you load the site, the background is a different color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://talkpython.fm/"&gt;Talk Python To Me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am biased here as my language of choice is Python, but one of the things that makes this podcast great are the guests that come in and talk about what they are doing to move Python forward, whether that's contributing directly to Python or creating libraries and frameworks to keep developers productive. A noteable episode to check out is the episode where they talk about what is new in Flask 1.0, which can be found here: &lt;a href="https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/177/flask-goes-1.0"&gt;https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/177/flask-goes-1.0&lt;/a&gt;. Flask is a micro web framework written in Python, and it is often used to build web services, APIs, or quick proof of concepts. It's an amazing little framework that is very flexible and allows developers to pick and choose how they want to use the tool instead of the tool dictating how it should be used. Flask had been at version 0.12 for a long time, so when it finally hit 1.0, this was a big deal for the Python community, especially those who use Python for the web. In the interview, the maintainer talks about the story behind Flask and where Flask is going next. One of my favorite things about this episode is when they talk about how easy it can be to contribute to open source projects. I believe conversations like that are important to encourage those out there that want to contribute something but are unsure of how best to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.smashingsecurity.com/"&gt;Smashing Security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, hear me out here -- I know I am talking about development and programming, but I am sharing a security podcast that is not boring and makes security a more fun topic to discuss. Smashing Security is hosted by Graham Cluley and Carole Theriault, two security veterans, and they are full of personality, have great perspectives on security, and share some of the top news of the week without bogging you down with a ton of stories. They each bring a story to report and go into deep details about that story, helping you get context around the story and understand the security implication. Did I mention that they are also pretty hilarious? I enjoy their banter back and forward, and they keep me engaged throughout the show. One of the best parts of the show is the Pick of the Week, which is a segment where they share something that is not necessarily security-related. I get to learn about cool websites and tools from them during this segment, and I usually share those findings with people in our Slack channel or with my coworkers. As developers, having an understanding of security and being aware of what is going on in our worl of technology helps us make better decisions when writing software. No customer ever asked for the buffer overflow in their product. A noteable episode has to be the one where Graham learns about what Rule 34 is (&lt;a href="https://www.smashingsecurity.com/101"&gt;https://www.smashingsecurity.com/101&lt;/a&gt;). It is just too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are three recommendations for podcasts to check out that I can vouch for as I have been listening to them for a long time, but if you are looking for something new to listen to, please check out this resource &lt;a href="https://simpleprogrammer.com/ultimate-list-developer-podcasts/"&gt;https://simpleprogrammer.com/ultimate-list-developer-podcasts/&lt;/a&gt; for more shows that might help you grow in your career. A simple piece of advice, though: when going  through that giant list, focus on the things that you care about. What are you learning now, and what podcasts exist for that particular topic? You will not become a software development master by listening to podcasts, but what listening to podcasts does for you is expose you to new concepts and ideas to explore later. Part of learning is also exploring the known unknowns and discovering things that used to be unknown unknowns. Podcasts provide us this opportunity, and I recommend everyone check out something new when they get a chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome all members of the San Antonio Web Developers community and Slack group. I do
apologize for the late entry for this article but better late then never. At the time of
this writing there are 13 hrs (CST) until the first challenge is released.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an open invitation and challenge to all developers who want to flex their skills
or try out a new language while solving programming puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is Advent of Code (AoC)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are unfamiliar with AoC, I would recommned that you go to their about page &lt;a href="https://adventofcode.com/2018/about"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new puzzle is release / unlocked at midnight EST/UTC-5 every day from Dec 1 to Dec 25&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Do I Join&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you will need to sign in to &lt;a href="https://adventofcode.com/"&gt;Advent of Code&lt;/a&gt;, You can link
with your Github, Google or Email address. Once you are registered you can join the SA Developers
private leaderboard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To join the private leaderboard, click on the link &lt;code&gt;[LeaderBoard]&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;[Private Leaderboard]&lt;/code&gt;
There should be an input box for you to enter the private leaderboard code below to join in on the
reindeer games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or just use this link &lt;a href="https://adventofcode.com/2018/leaderboard/private"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and enter the code below.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SA DEVS PRIVATE LEADERBOARD CODE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;215653-c4570711&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also post comments / questions / ~~boast of programming superiority~~ help other
members of the SADev community. This should be a &lt;strong&gt;FUN&lt;/strong&gt; way to interact with each other. &lt;strong&gt;#devsbeingchill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is this worth my time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objectively, YES. You get to meet / compete with other developers in the SA Developer community
and bask in the glory that is being higher ranked than some other seasoned developers. Bwahahaha!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also a gift card / cash prize for the winner or potential winners at the end of the challenge.
As of this writing, the current prize is valued at 💰$70💰. The prize purse can potentially grow depending
on the generousity of other developers in the community who wish to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, why would you want to do this? We are a group of developers who are active in our Slack group, but one of the main problems is that we have a lot of knowledge that we are not writing down in a more permanent place. When we share articles or advice on a technical topic, those messages will get lost with all of the other messages that people are sending as we are not paying for our Slack subscription. Therefore, in order to share our knowledge with people and show other cities that the developers in San Antonio are knowledgeable, collaborative, and willing to share their experience with the rest of the world, we are giving developers here an opportunity to share articles on their thoughts, experiences, and knowledge of how to use the technologies we use every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good opportunity for you to contribute something to the community without that much effort! In order to do so, here is how you do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fork the repo!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our site is a static site hosted somewhere out there on the Internet. Super mysterious. You can find the repository of our site here: &lt;a href="https://github.com/SADevs/sadevs.github.io"&gt;https://github.com/SADevs/sadevs.github.io&lt;/a&gt;. Fork this repository and clone it to your local machine. The site is powered by Pelican, which is a static site generator written in Python. If you have Python on your machine and you want to see what your article looks like on your local machine, install Pelican by typing in your terminal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;pip install pipenv # if you don&amp;#39;t have pipenv on your machine already
pipenv install
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This will get the necessary packages to use this static site generator. To build and run the site locally, use the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;pipenv run pelican content -vvv -o output -s pelicanconf.py
cd output
python -m http.server
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Open a browser and go to http://localhost:8000 to view the content. Note that the links will link to the actual site instead of the locally generated site, so if you made changes and you are not seeing them, check the URL at the top to see where you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't care about what your article looks like on the site and just want to write content, copy this template to get you started into a new file with a relevant name of your article and ending with a markdown extension:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;How&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Pelican&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2018&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Tags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;how&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;docs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Slug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;how&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pelican&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Authors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Omar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Quimbaya&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Summary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;short&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tutorial&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;how&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Pelican&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;How&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Pelican&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;goes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;example&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;hello world&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="err"&gt;##&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Secondary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Heading&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="err"&gt;###&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Tertiary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Heading&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Links&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;more&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;information&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;](&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;://&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;blog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;getpelican&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Once your document is done and you feel like you've said all you could about a topic, commit and push that to the &lt;code&gt;website&lt;/code&gt; branch of your clone repository. Go to your repo and submit a pull request to add your changes to the site. Once an admin reviews your article and accepts the pull request, it will start some automation that will publish the article to the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any more questions or require additional details, please let @PropagandaPanda4 know on the Slack group. He can edit the article and add additional details.&lt;/p&gt;
