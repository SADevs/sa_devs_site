# SA Devs Website 

This project is to develop a static website for the San Antonio Developers group. It's a place for news, blogs, and updates regarding San Antonio Developers and their meetups.

If you are interested in joining the group, please go to our website at [https://sanantoniodevs.com](https://sanantoniodevs.com) and click on `Slack`. You will be able to use that link to join the community.

If you want to contribute to this project, please continue reading.

We are using [Pelican](https://getpelican.com) to generate the static files necessary for the site. If you would like to contribute a theme or content to the site, please fork this repository and create a pull request. 

In order to run Pelican on your machine, please use Python 3.6 and go from there.

Yeah, that's basically it. I mean, if you've gone this far, you must be doing pretty well for yourself, right? :panda_face:
