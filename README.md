We are using [Pelican](https://getpelican.com) to generate the static files necessary for the site.

Instructions on how to do this can be found here: [https://sanantoniodevs.com/how-to-add-docs.html](https://sanantoniodevs.com/how-to-add-docs.html).

If there are questions and concerns, please reach out to any of the admins of the Slack group. Their usernames are available on the site here: [https://sanantoniodevs.com/pages/rules.html](https://sanantoniodevs.com/pages/rules.html).
