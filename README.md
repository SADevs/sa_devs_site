# Oh, hi there

Welcome to the repository for the SA Devs Slack Group. We are a group of developers from around San Antonio, including some cool dudes in Austin, that share insights, help solve problems, and ask a ton of questions to each other. We're like Stack Overflow but with gifs and emojis.

This site is meant to solve one major problem: how to get people to join the group automatically. We have the Github repo with the join link, but it makes more sense to give people a URL to go to and a button they can click to get moving. 

We can add more things along the way, but for now, this is meant to solve that one little problem and give people a place to go. 

Also, I think it's fun to build websites. 

So if you want to join us, go to the website! [Here it is!](https://sadevs.github.io/)

We're good people, honest. There might be one or two trolls in our group, but we never feed them. It keeps them at bay.
